# Roadmap

The public version of this API document is a minimal value product. Like all matters related to work, the scope of this document was contrained by resources, both time and financial.

Several udpates and revisions are planned for the next three to six months.

## Current release

Version 1, June 19, 2024


## Planned Version 1.1

Add tutorials.

| Resource | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| `shifts`     | Create a shift  |
| `shifts`     | Edit a shift  |
| `shifts`     | Delete a shift  |
| `shifts`     | Get a shift by a property  |
| `workers`    | Update a specific worker's information  |
| `workers`    | Delete a worker |
| `workers`    | Get a worker by a property  |

## Version 1.2

The following instructions describe how to set up a system for a Windows machine. To prepare a MacOS machine for the tutorial, visit the MacOS installation guide.

You need the following:

* A [GitHub account](https://github.com)
* A development system (e.g. PC, Mac, or Linux) running a current or
long-term support (LTS version of the operating system).

You'll need the following software on your development system:

* [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) (for the command line).
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) (optional).
* A fork of the [Who's Working service repo](https://github.com/writingteacher/who-working) and a clone on your local machine.
* A current/LTS version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* A current version of [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).
* A current copy of the database file. You can get this by syncing your fork.
* The [Postman desktop app](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Because you run the **Who's Working service** on your development system with an `http://localhost` hostname, the web version of Postman can't perform the exercises.

**TIP**: If you're using a clone of the repo on your desktop, create a working branch for your work. Create a new branch for each task to prevent a mistake in one from affecting your work in another.

## Testing your development system

To test your development system, follow these steps:

Create and checkout a working branch of your **Who's Working** service clone. Your `GitHub repo workspace` is the directory that contains the `Who's Working` clone. The database file that you need to access in the API folder is called `shift-db-source.json`.

    ```shell
    cd < your GitHub repo workspace >
    ls
    # (see the who-working service directory in the list)
    cd who-working
    cd api
    json-server -w shift-db-source.json
    ```

If your development system is installed correctly, you should see the service start and display the URL of the service: `http://localhost:3000`.

Make a test call to the service.

```json
curl http://localhost:3000/shifts
```

If the service is running correctly, you should see a list of shifts from the service, such as in this example.

```js
{
    "id": "1",
    "date": "2024-06-01",
    "start_time": "0700",
    "shift_length": "4",
    "warning": "opening",
    "location_detail": "Eatons Centre",
    "status": "open"
},
{
    "id": "2",
    "date": "2024-06-03",
    "start_time": "1030",
    "shift_length": "4",
    "warning": "none",
    "location_detail": "Yorkville Mall",
    "status": "open"
}
```

If you don't see the list of `shifts`, or receive an error in any step
of the procedure, investigate and correct the error before continuing.
Some common situations that cause errors include:

1. You mistyped a command.
2. You aren't in the correct directory.
3. A required software component didn't install correctly.
4. A required software component isn't up to date.

If you see the list of shifts from the service, you're ready to do the [quickstart guide](../api/quickstart_working.md) or a [tutorial](update-a-shift.md).
