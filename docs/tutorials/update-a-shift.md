# Tutorial: Find a specific shift and update two properties

In this tutorial, you learn how to find a shift and update properties with the `PATCH` METHOD. The use case is very practical - a store manager creates a new shift by locating an old one with a **CLOSED** status and then changing the shift date and status (from CLOSED to OPEN). Knowing how to update a shift helps store managers save time. They can quickly generate a new shift from a previous record and avoid creating a new shift from scratch.

Expect this tutorial to take about 15 minutes to complete.

## Before you start

Make sure you've completed the [Before you start a tutorial](before-you-start-a-tutorial) topic on the development system you'll use for the tutorial.

## Locating an existing shift

The first step is to display a list of shifts with the CLOSED status, find the record that needs to be updated, and note the ID number. Viewing a specific shift record requires the `GET` method.

1. Open the Postman app on your desktop.
1. In the Postman app, create a new request with these values:
    * **METHOD**: GET
    * **URL**: `{server_url}/shifts?status=closed`
    * **Headers**:`Content-Type: application/json`
    * **Request body**: None

Sample call.
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/shifts?status=closed'
```

In the Postman app, select **Send** to make the request. The service returns a JSON object that contains all closed shifts. Each shift has the following format. Note the `id` of the shift to update.

```js
[
    {
        "id": "03b6",
        "date": "2024-07-13",
        "start_time": "0900",
        "shift_length": "6",
        "warning": "opening",
        "location_detail": "Eatons Centre",
        "status": "closed"
    },
    {
        "id": "03d3",
        "date": "2024-06-11",
        "start_time": "0900",
        "shift_length": "6",
        "warning": "opening",
        "location_detail": "Eatons Centre",
        "status": "closed"
    },
    {
        "id": "81a2",
        "date": "2024-06-11",
        "start_time": "0900",
        "shift_length": "6",
        "warning": "opening",
        "location_detail": "Eatons Centre",
        "status": "closed"
    }
]
```

## Updating shift information

Now that you know the shift `id`, send a PATCH request to the /shifts/{id} endpoint to update the record.

To update shift properties:

In Postman, create a new request with these values:

* **METHOD**: PATCH
* **URL**: `{server_url}/shifts/{id}`
* **Headers**:`Content-Type: application/json`

Sample call for shift ID 03b6.
```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'http://localhost:3000/shifts/03b6' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data ' {
    "date": "2024-07-22",
    "status": "open"
}'
```

In the Request Body, add the properties and parameters that require an update. In this example, the date changes to July 22, and the status changes from `CLOSED` to `OPEN`.

```js
{
    "date": "2024-07-22",
    "status": "open"
}
```

Click **Send**. The service updates the shift record and returns a 200 OK along with the updated task as a JSON object.

```js
{
    "id": "03b6",
    "date": "2024-07-22",
    "start_time": "0900",
    "shift_length": "6",
    "warning": "opening",
    "location_detail": "Eatons Centre",
    "status": "open"
}
 ```
