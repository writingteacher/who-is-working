# `workers` resource

Base endpoint:

```shell
{server_url}/workers
```

Contains information about the workers saved to the Who's Working service. In Version 1, only registered store managers can create a worker record. In Version 2, the roadmap includes a feature that will allow registered workers to create and update their own record on the app.
